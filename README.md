# Astray

A WebGL maze game built with Three.js and Box2dWeb. Play it here: http://wwwtyro.github.io/Astray/

### Launching

~~There are several ways to launch the game. Here is the simplest:~~

~~1. Clone or download the repository~~
~~2. Navigate to Astray's directory~~
~~3. Start 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' in your shell (for python 3.0 and above type 'python -m http.server' in your shell)~~
~~4. Open 'localhost:8000' in your browser~~
~~5. Enjoy!~~

Launch this game by downloading the zip and opening up the index.html file. I encoded the files into the files.js script, so that there aren't CORS errors, and you can play this without a webserver. I also added WASD controls support.
